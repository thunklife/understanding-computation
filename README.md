Understanding Computation
=========================

This repo contains ports of code examples from [Tom Stuart]("https://twitter.com/tomstuart")'s book [Understanding Computation]("http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Computation-Machines-Impossible-Programs/dp/1449329276").
None of these ideas are my own; just trying to practice Haskell.
